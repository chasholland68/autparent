                            I haven’t visited since they opened the Bracken Foundation Children’s Garden. 
                            I don’t have to see it to know that it is beautiful. Everything about this 
                            place is beautiful all year round, but especially in the Spring and Summer. A 
                            lot of parents who have experience visiting know to bring a wagon and pack a 
                            lunch for a picnic while they are there. <br> <br>

                            I don’t quiet have the most leisurely experience due to the fact that my 
                            daughter wants to jump in every pond, lake and fountain that she sees. When I 
                            tell her that she can’t she usually has a big meltdown, which involves 
                            screaming and kicking with inevitable confused looks from other families walking 
                            by. I know that I shouldn’t care, but I have to be honest that it makes me 
                            self-conscious every time. <br> <br>

                            She also enjoys grabbing flowers and ripping them apart, so this is the type of 
                            place that involves me playing a lot of defense. It is a lot of stress and effort 
                            on my part as the “autism parent.” I am at a full upper lip sweat after 15 minutes 
                            of being there. There is an indoor section that has a lot of “don’t touch” signs 
                            that my daughter is going to obviously ignore, so there is no real place to take 
                            her that doesn’t have some kind of tactile/destruction opportunity. <br> <br>

                            It’s so pretty though!! I still go maybe once or twice a year to maybe get a pretty 
                            Fall picture of her with the pumpkins or maybe I’m feeling down and I want to punish 
                            myself for no real reason. I just wear workout gear and pack water while I mentally 
                            prepare like I’m about to do a marathon. Then when I leave Cheekwood, I think about 
                            how I’m not coming back anytime soon.
